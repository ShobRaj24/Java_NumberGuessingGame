# Java_NumberGuessingGame
Oasis Infobyte Java Development Internship
I had the opportunity to create a fun and interactive 'Guess the Number' Java project. In this game, users try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The project involved building a graphical user interface using Swing, which includes elements like input fields, buttons, and labels.

The game initiates with a random target number and a limited number of attempts. Users can enter their guesses, and the system provides feedback on the accuracy of each attempt. If the player correctly guesses the number, they receive a congratulatory message. If they exceed the maximum attempts, the game reveals the correct number. It's a great example of responsive and interactive user experience design.
